`node index` will run this as it is right now, which is incomplete. You'll need to setup a mongodb and provide the URL in a .env file or similar, as well as BC API credentials. Example below:

```
MONGO=mongodb+srv://user:pass@domain/database
CLIENT=BC CLIENT ID
TOKEN=BC TOKEN
SECRET=BC SECRET
HASH=BC HASH
PORT=3333
```
